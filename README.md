## Rules:

  ### Consideration Rule: 

  if( input > threshold corresponding symptom)
     then return true;
  else false;


  ### MinMaxLimit Rule:

  User Input should only varies in range between 0-10
  if( user input is less than 0) then take input as 0;
  if( user input is greater than 10) then take input as 10;

  ### CalculatedScore rule or Method:

  for each symptom input array:
    score += symptom.weight* (symptom.rating-symptom.threshold);

  ### Result rule:

    if(calculateScore()===0){
      return 'You do not have any depression.'
    }
    else if(calculateScore()<=13){
      return 'You are not at all under any condition of experiencing depression However there may be some situatiions where you are feeling bit pressure kindly Avoid that situations'
    }
    else if(calculateScore()>13 && calculateScore()<=22){
      return 'You may be experiencing mild depression, and it is recommended to take self-care measures or consult a healthcare professional'
    }
    else if(calculateScore()>22 && calculateScore()<=35){
      return 'You may be experiencing moderate depression and should consider seeking professional help.'
    }
    else if(calculateScore()> 35){
        return 'You may be experiencing severe depression and should seek professional help immediately.'
    }

This code outlines the signs and danger signs of depression as well as the guidelines for diagnosing depression. Additionally, it specifies the inquiries to be made of the patient and the primary role of the inquiry and rule evaluation in the diagnosis of depression. The system publishes a message advising further assessment and therapy by a mental health professional if the patient satisfies the criteria for depression. If not, the system produces a note urging further monitoring and, if necessary, medical advice.
